important parts of assignment
 

meanings of commands i ran through in powershell and docker:

- pwd = print working directory (tells me which folder im in right now).
- dir = directory listing (shows me what is inside the folder im  currently in. Eg: pennacool-intern-exercise has docker-compose, app (index.php), dockerfile, readme, db, bridge).
- cd = change directory (moves me into another folder that i tell it to...go into this folder)
- docker-compose up --build = starts up the docker app/ reads the docker-compose.yml/ starts all containers web and db, connecting them together [builds and starts up the whole docker app])
- docker-compose down = shuts down everything 
- docker ps = docker process status (shows me what containers are currently running)
- ctrl + C (in docker app) = stops running a command


STEP BY STEP PROCESS:

1. opened powershell/terminal by clicking the windows key 
2. went specifically to the project folder by opening the intern exercise folder (cd Downloads\pennacool-intern-exercise\pennacool-intern-exercise)
3. started up the docker app by typing in this: docker-compose up --build. This reads the docker compose file, building the PHP/Apache container and the MySQL, connecting them together.
4. ran the "http://localhost:8080/index.php" on my google chrome, this is where i got some issues (because i did not connect the app folder or create the index.php file yet -- i will attach screenshots as required within the email).
5. created an index.php file, which i put into the app folder. It contained important sql code like: $host = 'db';
$db   = 'studentsdb';
$user = 'studentuser';
$pass = 'studentpw';
The database host is called db, which is the service name of the MySQL container in Docker Compose. Docker handles the networking, so PHP can connect using that name.
6. new PDO(...) this means that I’m using PDO to connect to MySQL. If the connection fails, the app stops and shows me an error  message.
7. SELECT * FROM students -- on page load, i query the students table, fetching all the records
8. fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC). this returns all the data as an array, looping through to generate the HTML table. The correct output of the "http://localhost:8080/index.php" will be shown on the email as an attachment
9. I then used the GET form to search the value which appears in the URL (<form method="get">)
10. If I enter a search term, I modify the SQL query using a LIKE condition ($search = $_GET['search'] ?? '';)
11. my prepared statement was used to prevent SQL injection (WHERE last_name LIKE ?)
12. I will attach the output of the live filter working by typing in a last name "Gomes"
